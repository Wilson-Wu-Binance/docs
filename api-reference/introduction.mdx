## Welcome

The HashDit API provides threat intelligence for analyzing domains and URLs for potential security risks. Use the API to check domains and receive detailed risk assessments with severity scores and indicators.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key passed in the `X-API-KEY` header.

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://service.hashdit.io
```

## Getting started

To get started with the HashDit API:

1. Obtain your API key from the HashDit team
2. Include your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header for all requests
3. Make requests to the appropriate endpoint with the required parameters

description: 'Blockchain networks and their chain IDs supported by HashDit API endpoints'
---

## Supported Networks

The HashDit API supports the following blockchain networks:

| Network | Chain ID |
|---------|----------|
| Ethereum Mainnet | 1 |
| Binance Smart Chain | 56 |
| Solana | N/A |

## Endpoint Chain Support

Different API endpoints support different blockchain networks. Use the table below to determine which chains are available for each endpoint:

| Endpoint | Ethereum Mainnet (1) | Binance Smart Chain (56) | Solana |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------------|--------|
| [Domain Security](/api-reference/endpoint/domain-security) | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| [Address Classification](/api-reference/endpoint/address-classify) | ✓ | ✓ | ❌ |
| [Address Security v2](/api-reference/endpoint/address-security-v2) | ✓ | ✓ | ❌ |
| [Token Security](/api-reference/endpoint/token-security) | ✓ | ✓ | ❌ |
| [Transaction Security](/api-reference/endpoint/transaction-security) | ✓ | ✓ | ❌ |
| [Transaction Simulation](/api-reference/endpoint/txn-simulation) | ✓ | ✓ | ❌ |
| [Solana Token Security](/api-reference/endpoint/solana-token-security) | ❌ | ❌ | ✓ |

<Info>
When making API requests, use the chain ID as a string value (e.g., `"1"` for Ethereum Mainnet or `"56"` for Binance Smart Chain).
</Info>

<Tip>
The Domain Security endpoint does not require a chain ID as it analyzes domains and URLs rather than blockchain addresses. The Solana Token Security endpoint uses Solana addresses directly and does not require a chain ID parameter.
</Tip>

## Usage

Include the `chainId` or `chain_id` parameter in your request body when calling address-related endpoints:

<CodeGroup>
```json Address Classification / Address Security v2
{
  "chainId": "1",
  "address": "0x..."
}
```

```json Transaction Simulation
{
  "chain_id": "56",
  "block_height": "58083468",
  "evm_transactions": [...]
}
```

```json Solana Token Security
{
  "address": "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

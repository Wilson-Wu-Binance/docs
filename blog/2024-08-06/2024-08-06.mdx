# HashDit 2024 BNB Smart Chain (BSC) H1 Security Report

## Overview
<p>This report focuses on security events that happened on BSC in 2024 H1, analyzing the type of projects targeted and sharing the common attack techniques used in 2024 H1, with respect to the financial loss of the incidents.</p>

### Disclaimer
<p>The financial data provided here is accurate based on our own monitoring system and based on the \$USD amount of the cryptocurrency involved at the time of the incident. Due to the fluctuating price nature of cryptocurrencies, the total amount loss might differ with the current token valuations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the financial data might not fully reflect the true “exploited amount” of the incident. This is especially true for scams where the total scammed amount is usually mixed with an initial base amount injected by the scam project party.</p>

</p>

<p>In 2021, the decentralized finance (DeFi) market experienced unprecedented growth, with numerous protocols launching without adequate security measures. This lack of security awareness allowed malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Since then, there has been a stronger emphasis on security for DeFi protocols, leading to a significant reduction in impactful exploits. As a result, financial losses in the first half of 2024 dropped by 83% compared to the same period in 2023 (\$101 million), marking a substantial improvement. Attack vectors analysis</p>

<p>Out of the 73 security incidents, hacks take up 80.82%, while 19.18% are scams.</p>

## Conclusion

<p>In the first half of 2024, total losses caused by hacks, phishing scams, and rug pulls dropped to \$17.2 million, compared to \$101 million in the same period in 2023. This significant reduction indicates an overall improvement in the security situation on Binance Smart Chain (BSC).</p>

<p>In 2023, the most damaging attack vector was rug pulls. However, in 2024, the most damaging attacks have shifted to price manipulation. This change underscores the critical need for web3 projects to avoid reliance on the instantaneous price of liquidity pools and not depend solely on the balance of tokens in a contract. It is essential to consider the risks associated with flash loans and direct transfers that can impact token prices. To enhance security, projects should consider using entity oracles like Chainlink for a secure price feed.</p>

<p>Below we have some final tips for investors and developers:</p>

<p>For investors:</p>
1. **Understand What You're Signing:** Never blindly sign random signatures or transactions. Always ensure signatures are from official websites.
2. **Verify Official Websites:** Double-check that you are on the official website of the DApp.
3. **Exercise Caution with New/Trending Projects:** Be wary of projects that guarantee high APYs or use MEV bots. Always verify the project team’s authenticity.
4. **Use Multiple Wallets:** Utilize different wallets for various activities—hot wallets for frequent transactions and cold wallets for storing high-value funds.
5. **Interact with Open-Source Contracts:** Ensure you are interacting with open-source contracts and revoke approval once the interaction is complete.
6. **Check Risk Warnings:** Use tools like Metamask Snaps and HashDit Extension to check risk warnings of transactions.
7. **Heed Warnings on Trust Wallet and PancakeSwap:** Pay attention to warnings about phishing sites, malicious contracts, and dangerous tokens. If flagged as high risk, it is strongly advised to stay away.


<p>For developers:</p>
1. **Verify & Open-Source Contracts:** Ensure all relevant contracts are verified and open-sourced on-chain to maintain transparency and trust.
2. **Conduct Audits:** Have the project audited by at least two well-known security companies and address all identified issues, including newly added code.
3. **Implement a Bug-Bounty Program:** Encourage the community to help maintain the security of the code by offering rewards for identifying vulnerabilities.
4. **Prioritize Security:** Run sufficient testing, stress-testing, and simulations for scenarios such as adverse token price fluctuations and edge cases.
5. **Prevent Centralization Risks:** Use multi-signature wallets instead of a single EOA wallet for operations.
6. **Minimize Contract Upgradeability:** Limit contract upgradeability and apply changes only when necessary.
7. **Secure Fund Storage:** Ensure funds are stored securely through proper key management and fund distribution.
8. **Implement Safeguards:** Formulate an incident response plan and introduce time locks or pausing mechanisms within smart contracts to mitigate the impact of hacks.
9. **Monitor System Parameters:** Continuously monitor system parameters, such as the exchange rate of tokens.

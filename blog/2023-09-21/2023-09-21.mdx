## High Risk TVL protocol on PCS

<p>In this week, there were **30** newly identified risky addresses.</p>
**Trending** newly identified risky addresses:

<p>| Address      | 	ContractName |	Weekly Active Transactions | | ----------- | 	----------- |	----------- | |0x1bec5734b1e4559979158052dfa5c6f0156282f2|	Portaldot (POT)|	546| |0x4fc75a68c38a700aac53a34784d6d9917932ea0e|	VCH|	66| |0x9d173e6c594f479b4d47001f8e6a95a7adda42bc|	CryptoZoon|	41| |0x902d9367a4de541926e1ed55287fac8eed959d6d|	ASB|	35| |0xa77346760341460b42c230ca6d21d4c8e743fa9c|	MicroPets|	33| |0xadcfc6bf853a0a8ad7f9ff4244140d10cf01363c|	TrustPad|	25| |0x767b04d1f1dde2a056cec1ab3bd51d1c286366db|	AAToken|	20| |0x00000065cbadead116136940b302f938284f2bdc|	Poop|	10| |0xea51801b8f5b88543ddad3d1727400c15b209d8f|	INUKO|	10| |0x2fb6212111dad926902febcfd8daa3eb44f1ca56|	YATANCAKE|	10|</p>

### Key themes on high risks:

1. Exactly half of the newly identified risky addresses (46%) were through **threat intelligence**. These addresses are either confirmed rugpulls (project has already removed rugged) or scam tokens that have high risk of rugs.

2. **Red Alarm projects** are manually identified by our security team for being potential scams. These are identified from a project level, for example projects that utilize fake social media marketing, or create scam meme projects. They are labeled under the DApps section of this [page](https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/red-alarm)(36%)

3. Another theme for these contracts is that they are **unverified**. This means that the source code is unavailable, which could present some risks as scammers might hide malicious code in their contracts. This portion represents 6% of the total newly identified risky addresses.

<p>Refer to this [link](https://github.com/hashdit/hashdit/blob/main/gitbook_source_code/data/09212023_most_popular_risky_address.csv) for the full list.</p>

Tip: Filter by Top_TVL_Risky_Pool / Trending_Risky_Pool / Trending_Risky_Tokens to retrieve the risky addresses from different sources.

## Integrations with PancakeSwap
<p>Hashdit has partnered with PancakeSwap to integrate the DappBay’s Red Alarm. The risk score level reflects how risky the interacted token is, helping users make better informed decisions.</p>


Example: Fake Circle Token - 0x84ef2e2e977062da3cfc12c038fa3ce2d42d01b1

<p>Please take note that the risk level in Pancake & Risk Scanner might be different, because [Hashdit](https://www.hashdit.io/en) use more conservative strategies for PancakeSwap than [DappBay](https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/) risk scanner.</p>

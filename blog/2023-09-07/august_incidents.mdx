## Security Control Improvements in the BSC Ecosystem
1. HashDit has integrated its security API with Prominent and Leading brands on BSC such as [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/), [TrustWallet](https://trustwallet.com/), [BscScan](https://trustwallet.com/) to improve the security control across the ecosystem.

2. New risks flagged in [RedAlarm](https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/red-alarm)

<p>A total of 319 dApps and 64 addresses were added to Hashdit's RedAlarm in August alone. This amounts to a total of 1679 smart contracts on RedAlarm currently.</p>

## Word of Advice
<p>With the current trends in the BSC security landscape, Hashdit advices the community to:</p>
1. Do Your Own Research (DYOR) before participating in any trending projects to mitigate the risk of financial losses, especially when the token name and symbol is an impersonation of the real token.
2. Place greater emphasis on security, adopt a Zero-Trust security mentality and be careful of phishing scams

<p>Meanwhile, HashDit promises to continue to keep the BSC community and its users safe!</p>

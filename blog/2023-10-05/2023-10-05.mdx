## High Risk TVL protocol on PCS

<p>In this week, there were **16** newly identified risky addresses.</p>
**Trending** newly identified risky addresses:

<p>| Address      | 	ContractName |	Weekly Active Transactions | | ----------- | 	----------- |	----------- | |0xbcb24afb019be7e93ea9c43b7e22bb55d5b7f45d|	BSCSToken|	237| |0x7b86f5ca09dc00502e342b0fef5117e1c32222ce|	SOLCash|	32| |0x94db03752342bc9b5bbf89e3bf0132494f0cb2b3|	Dogai (DOGAI)|	27| |0x4ee98216499b81a9942e7aa77970b68c792ff679|	SCT|	20| |0x638deed975af106d7d721f92047b369f82241020|	JiangNanYi|	14| |0xacb8f52dc63bb752a51186d1c55868adbffee9c1|	BunnyPark|	13|</p>

### Key themes on high risks:

1. **Red Alarm projects** are manually identified by our security team for being potential scams. These are identified from a project level, for example projects that utilize fake social media marketing, or create scam meme projects. They are labeled under the DApps section of this [page](https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/red-alarm)(31%)

2. Another theme for these contracts is that they have a privileged role, e.g owner is an EOA, which could mean some **centralization** risk as the owner can mint or toggle honeypot mode at will, so there could be rugpull risk. This portion represents 31% of the total newly identified risky addresses.

3. A quarter of the newly identified risky addresses (25%) were through **threat intelligence**. These addresses are either confirmed rugpulls (project has already removed rugged) or scam tokens that have high risk of rugs.

<p>Refer to this [link](https://github.com/hashdit/hashdit/blob/main/gitbook_source_code/data/10052023_most_popular_risky_address.csv) for the full list.</p>

Tip: Filter by Top_TVL_Risky_Pool / Trending_Risky_Pool / Trending_Risky_Tokens to retrieve the risky addresses from different sources.

## Integrations with PancakeSwap
<p>Hashdit has partnered with PancakeSwap to integrate the DappBay’s Red Alarm. The risk score level reflects how risky the interacted token is, helping users make better informed decisions.</p>


Example: Fake Circle Token - 0x84ef2e2e977062da3cfc12c038fa3ce2d42d01b1

<p>Please take note that the risk level in Pancake & Risk Scanner might be different, because [Hashdit](https://www.hashdit.io/en) use more conservative strategies for PancakeSwap than [DappBay](https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/) risk scanner.</p>

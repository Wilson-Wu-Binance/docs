## High Risk TVL protocol on PCS

<p>In this week, there were **252** newly identified risky addresses.</p>
**Trending** newly identified risky addresses:

<p>| Address      | 	ContractName |	Weekly Active Transactions | | ----------- | 	----------- |	----------- | |0xa68c9c2c39176b3ee9f6359b68e853893c6ddc5a|	PIG9|	4788| |0x150cbd6e82d63db545ff8904de365b9154b0b386|	DGTT|	2370| |0x2266362f414bf2476c5465dc2ea953fe2a99ae1c|	Fake ZRO|	2296| |0xb1d4e33dd4aa6204bc8aae340b67455a662f038a|	LNL|	2262| |0x3e573bf50b7625d9976fd65a8c0cdfbbc7b63a10|	Multi-Cultural Connect (MCC)|	2227| |0x77087ab5df23cfb52449a188e80e9096201c2097|	hi Dollar (HI)|	1764| |0x4908b8977f91e2257e5260551e7dc2950b1b3877|	MARS (MARS)|	1203| |0xff71e87a2e7b818eee86f3f1c2e94a06cac85866|	Cat|	1085| |0x9fbd6973f7e6e49eac8ff2eb857fdeed41d2e482|	QUANTIC PROTOCOL (QUANTIC)|	1055| |0x7645444525bb2bd69ad23db57d3fc7b4fe3cda31|	Bitcoin Dao (BTCD)|	1028|</p>

### Key themes on high risks:

1. Exactly half of the newly identified risky addresses (50%) were through **threat intelligence**. These addresses are either confirmed rugpulls (project has already removed rugged) or scam tokens that have high risk of rugs.

2. **Red Alarm projects** are manually identified by our security team for being potential scams. These are identified from a project level, for example projects that utilize fake social media marketing, or create scam meme projects. They are labeled under the DApps section of this page(17%)

3. Another theme for these contracts is that they have a **privileged role**, e.g owner is an EOA, which could mean some centralization risk as the owner can mint or toggle honeypot mode at will, so there could be rugpull risk. This portion represents 15% of the total newly identified risky addresses.

<p>Refer to this [link](https://github.com/hashdit/hashdit/blob/main/gitbook_source_code/data/08282023_most_popular_risky_address.csv) for the full list.</p>

Tip: Filter by Top_TVL_Risky_Pool / Trending_Risky_Pool / Trending_Risky_Tokens to retrieve the risky addresses from different sources.

## Integrations with PancakeSwap
<p>Hashdit has partnered with PancakeSwap to integrate the DappBay’s Red Alarm. The risk score level reflects how risky the interacted token is, helping users make better informed decisions.</p>


Example: Fake Circle Token - 0x84ef2e2e977062da3cfc12c038fa3ce2d42d01b1

<p>Please take note that the risk level in Pancake & Risk Scanner might be different, because [Hashdit](https://www.hashdit.io/en) use more conservative strategies for PancakeSwap than [DappBay](https://dappbay.bnbchain.org/) risk scanner.</p>
